- This is the official repository for the paper **Inversion-Free Style Transfer with Dual Rectified Flows**.

  - We present a training-free style transfer method that synthesizes stylized images without relying on computationally expensive and unstable inversion processes. By leveraging a dual rectified flow design, our method achieves efficient and high-fidelity stylization, overcoming key limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches.
