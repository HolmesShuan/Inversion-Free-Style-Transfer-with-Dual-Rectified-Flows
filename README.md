# Inversion-Free-Style-Transfer-with-Dual-Rectified-Flows



## 📖 Overview
<img src="assets/teaser_01.jpg" width="1080px"/>
This is the official repository for the paper **"Inversion-Free Style Transfer with Dual Rectified Flows"**.

We present a novel **training-free** style transfer method that synthesizes high-quality stylized images **without relying on computationally expensive and unstable inversion processes**. By leveraging a **dual rectified flow** design, our method achieves efficient and high-fidelity stylization, overcoming key limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches.
